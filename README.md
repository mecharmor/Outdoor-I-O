## What's Hunter Helper?


Hunter Helper is an IOS app designed for hunters who need an offline app to keep records of hunting paths and notes regarding scopes and the adjustments needed when hunting at various distances and terrains.

- Use **Core Location to track hunting path** (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation)
- User can **Add a weapon to their dashboard and modify attributes**
- User can **Start Hunt** so their traveled path will be saved so they can playback the trail they took
